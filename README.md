### A Basic Login and Regisration System


This is a project I was working on to practice Python GUI Programming with Tkinter, the de-facto Python GUI framework. It is basically a Login and Registration System. Gotta admitâ€”GUI programming is not my strong suit.


Required utilities:

Tkinter
SQLite


Credentials for the SQLite Database:

Admin Login:

User: root
Password: root

User Login:

User: 1111
Password: 1234
